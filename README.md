NJE for UNIX
=============



This NJE repo is is the third incarnation of the Hebrew University of Jersualem NJE protocol for UNIX and VMS. The original VMS repo is here: https://github.com/moshix/HUJInje

In this new version, it's been made to compile cleanly on Linux, BSD (including latest Macos!), as well as with the latest gcc and glibc systems present in Ubuntu 22.04 [thanks wschaub!]

You will need to ask to peer with somebody on HNET to use this protocol. Contact me if you have a 24/7 Linux server and you want to peer with my HNET main node RELAY (which is also based on UNIXNJE). See more: www.moshix.tech 

UnixNJE is fully compatible with the NJE protocol and connects effortlessly to VM/SP or z/VM RSCS, NJE38 for MVS 3.8, SineNomine NJE, JNET for openVMS, NJE for Windows. 

UnixNJE was tested in January 2025 for the following operating system.

INSTALL
------

get repo to your Linux/BSD/Macos (anything from the last 6-7 years should work)

then type "make" and watch it compile

Configuration
-------------

In /etc/funetnje create a file called funetnje.cf like this (just an example):
<pre>
#       Configuration file for FUNET-NJE program
#
NAME            SELXM1
IPADDRESS       111.111.111.195  #my IP address
QUEUE           /var/spool/bitnet # where my work spool is
CMDMAILBOX      U 127.0.0.1 175   #my port 175
LOG             /var/log/bitnet.log #log location
TABLE           /usr/local/funetnje/binroutes  #location of routes information (see below)
INFORM          MAINT@NODE1    # who will be informed of issues
USEREXITS       /usr/local/funetnje/file-exit.cf  #see my video (link below)

</pre>

in file /usr/local/funetnje/header.txt:
<pre>

</pre>
In file /usr/local/funetnje/routes.txt:
<pre>
ROUTE MOSHIX2       NODE1 ETHNET   CH
ROUTE MOSHIX4       NODE1 ETHNET   CH
ROUTE MOSHIX3       NODE1 ETHNET   CH
ROUTE MOSHIX5       NODE1 ETHNET   CH
ROUTE MOSHIX        NODE1 ETHNET   CH
</pre>



Running It
----------

To execute it you need sudo privileges, or need to be root. 

Run the binroutes command to create /usr/local/funetnje/binroutes, then start funetnje as a daemon

Enable "mesg yes" for your shell session to receive messages from other nodes. 

Commands available send to sendfiles or messages or commands. "qrdr" to see the file queue. See my video (link below)
